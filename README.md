`A gentle introduction to JavaScript; written by a newbie, for other newbies.`

There are plenty of awesome tutorials on the internet that promises to help you get started with JavaScript. I neither claim to be at par with them, nor do I intend to. I wrote this tutorial for two reasons:
  - I wanted to express my understanding of the basics as I learn them. I kept in mind the confusion and frustration newbies face, and the writing reflects my personal struggle to overcome them. I hope my empathy towards my fellow learners will strike the right chord.
  - My technical mentor wanted me to write such a piece as my first assignment ;-).
