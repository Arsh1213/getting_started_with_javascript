### Introduction
There are plenty of awesome tutorials on the internet that promises to help you get started with JavaScript. I neither claim to be at par with them, nor do I intend to. I wrote this tutorial for two reasons:
  - I wanted to express my understanding of the basics as I learn them. I kept in mind the confusion and frustration newbies face, and the writing reflects my personal struggle to overcome them. I hope my empathy towards my fellow learners will strike the right chord.
  - My technical mentor wanted me to write such a piece as my first assignment ;-).

This tutorial is _skin deep_, and I have consciously avoided big chunks of conventional Javascript basics. The intended audience are people with absolutely _no programming experience_, except familiarity with the basics of the web like HTML and CSS. If you are an experienced programmer who wants to learn JavaScript, you will be disappointed by the lack of coverage, both in terms of breadth and depth.
