# Getting Started With JavaScript 
#### _By a newbie, for the newbies._

## Why this book?
There are plenty of awesome tutorials on the internet that promises to help you get started with JavaScript. I neither claim to be at par with them, nor do I intend to. I wrote this booklet for two reasons:
  - I wanted to express my understanding of the basics as I learn them. I kept in mind the confusion and frustration newbies face, and the writing reflects my personal struggle to overcome them. I hope my empathy towards my fellow learners will strike the right chord.
  - My technical mentor wanted me to write such a piece as my first assignment ;-).

## Coverage
The material in this booklet is _skin deep_, and I have consciously avoided big chunks of conventional Javascript basics. The intended audience are people with absolutely _no programming experience_, except familiarity with the basics of the web like HTML and CSS. If you are an experienced programmer who wants to learn JavaScript, you will be disappointed by the lack of coverage, both in terms of breadth and depth.  

## Approach
The concepts are presented using a _bottom-up_ approach - the core concepts of programming have been prioritized over the JavaScript syntax. Another way of looking into it is to think of programming as the main activity, and JavaScript as a tool to express your thoughts. In fact, the best way to learn programming is to practice language-agnostic thinking. An advantage of this approach is that you can transfer the same concepts when you use other programming languages.

## How to read this book?
This book is meant to be read sequentially, as each chapter depends on the foundation of the preceding chapters. That said, experienced readers can jump back and forth between the chapters, since the chapters are reasonably self-contained. If you are a beginner, I _strongly recommend you to go through the chapters sequentially_. Also, please engage actively when you read this book - think about the concepts presented, doodle them, write a few lines of code to verify your idea. Never read any technical material passively like you would read a novel.

> I strongly believe that programming is best learnt by:     
    - Executing concrete examples     
    - Doodling illustrative figures that graphically represents the key concepts        
  Expect plenty of them throughout this mini booklet.    
  Also, please __don't ignore the questions I ask you to think about, and the small drills that I ask you to do__. They reinforce the concepts while you learn. They had served me good, and I hope they will be helpful for you too!
