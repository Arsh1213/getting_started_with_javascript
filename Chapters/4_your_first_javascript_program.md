# Your First JavaScript Program

If you have read the previous chapters carefully, then you should know the following:
  - Some generic programming best practices    
  - Variables    
  - Memory locations, maniplation and management     
  - Data Types - general as well as in context of JavaScript   
  - Utility of comments, and how comments are given in JavaScript    
  - Console mode of the interpreter   

The purpose of introducing you to those concepts is to prepare a strong foundation for programming. Even without writing a single line code yourself, you are in a position to think deeply about solving problems using programs, and also debug your programs analytically. 

> __Debugging__ is the activity of figuring out what's wrong with your program in terms of syntax, logic, dependencies, etc. You will debug a lot in course of yor journey to become a programmer - be mentally prepared for arduous sessions. In fact, a lot of exercises you will encounter in this booklet will involve analytical debugging, which is one of the best ways to forge a deep understanding of your programs and the environment in which they execute.
