# Objects and Arrays

> __NOTE to Readers__: From this chapter onward, there will be less textual explanation that what you have seen before in this book. Instead, you are expected to learn from the code and the comments. Building this habit will serve you extremely well, no matter you are writing code or writing about code. As an author, I will give my best to make the code self-explanatory in terms of structure, names, and comments.
