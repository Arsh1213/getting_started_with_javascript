# Welcome to JavaScript    

## Why should you learn JavaScript?

So you need some motivation! Umm... I'm sure there are many more, but right now I can think of these:  
  - __Necessity__ - [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is the _only_ programming language supported by the common web browsers. It's the tool you need to make your web pages alive and interactive. 
  - __Popularity__ - It's insanely popular! From technology giants to primary school students - everyone uses JavaScript. It's the most loved, discussed, and hated programming language globally. Based on [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018), nearly 70% of all questions asked on the platform are related to JavaScript. 
  - __Employability__ - Millions of programmers use JavaScript; for many, it is the first programming language they learned. They had charted out glittering careers as developers, bloggers, product mangers, analysts, etc. Learning JavaScript makes you employable in almost any corner of the planet where internet has pervaded.
  - __Applicability__ - Modern JavaScript allows us to write extremely complex and rich web applications, covering everything from backend code running on the server to frontend code running on the browsers and also cross-platform desktop applications, mobile applications, and also even program IOT devices. But beware of the deadly trap - professional JavaScript programmers are clustered in highly fragmented communities, each following a [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) like a religion. What's ridiculous is they change their religion as soon as a new hot religion emerges.
  - __Freedom__ - It's free, open source, and standardised by a committee behind [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). You don't need to pay anything to learn and apply it.
  - __Embarrassment__ - Not knowing the basics of JavaScript is embarrassing if you work in a technology company, and especially if the company has build it's product with JavaScript.     

  
## What's JavaScript?    

> JavaScript is a __loosely typed__, __interpreted__, and __object oriented__ programming language widely used for __scripting web applications__.

Oooff... that's quite a heavy and geeky definition! But what does it really mean? Let's break it into chunks and understand what they mean at a very high level. In due course, you will also learn some of the things that are common with other programming languages like Python, Java, etc.

  - `loosely typed`    
  There are two categories of programming languages when it comes to strictness of typecasting data - _statically typed_, and _loosely/dynamically typed_. JavaScript belongs to the later category, although JavaScript fanboys prefer to call it "duck typing", which roughly translates into "sacrificing rigour of typecasting data in favour of flexibility of writing logic and managing memory".      
  
  - `interpreted`     
  There are two types of programming languages - _interpreted_, and _compiled_. Most scripting languages like JavaScript, Python, Bash, Lua, etc. are interpreted, while the programming langages like C++, C, etc. are compiled. Java is somewhere in between - it gets compiled to produce bytecode, which runs on a [Java virtual machine (JVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) and not on the native processor.     
  > __NOTE__: I know what you are thinking - "... same gibberish filled with technical jargons without imparting proper understanding or some practical skills... ". We shall discuss the above two topics in detail in the next chapter [Programming 101](https://github.com/datasouvik/getting_started_with_javascript/blob/master/Chapters/2_programming101.md), which I hope will give you some clarity.
  - `object oriented`     
  There are three dominant programming paradigms that drives the philosophy of how software software should be written:
    - __Procedural__ - Programs can be written as procedures, or a sequence of steps/logic that you want the computer to perform on some data. Throughout the history of programming and software engineering, this has been one of the strongest philosophies, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.           
    - __Object Oriented__ - In this paradigm, software is written to imitate the nature where each entity has some properties and capabilities/behaviour. Java made this philosophy highly popular, and most big modern software are written keeping this approach in mind. To promote code reuse, modularity, ease of maintenance, etc., enterprise software are often designed by software architects using their darling paradigm - OOP.      
    - __Functional__ - Functional programming emerged when people with background from Mathematics, Statistics, Finance, etc. wanted to program just enough to test their ideas and algorithms, but the learning curve of a conventional programming language like C++ was disproportionately steep compared to their objectives behind programming. This paradigm is well suited for abstracting the low level programming details, so that domain experts can focus on their algorithms (which are often concurrent and multi-threaded). Programming languages like Haskell, Julia, Scala, etc. champion this approach.
    
    For now, it's enough to know that JavaScript primarily supports _procedural_ and _object oriented_ styles of programming very well, and may be with some tweaks can support basic _functional_ programming too.    
  
  - `scripting web applications`     
  JavaScript makes the web pages delightfully interactive for the users. In fact, the reason JavaScript is so popular despite it's severe shortcomings is that it's the only programming language that the web browsers understand (barring some text-only browsers like [elinks](http://elinks.or.cz/)). JavaScript empowers you to do almost anything you want with your web pages, once the pages are recieved by the browsers from the server. We shall discuss client-side programming in the chapter [Glimpse of client-side JavaScript](https://github.com/datasouvik/getting_started_with_javascript/blob/master/Chapters/8_glimpse_of_clientside_javascript.md). On the servers, you can use frameworks like [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) without learning an extra programming language.
