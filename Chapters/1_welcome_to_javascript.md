# Welcome to JavaScript    

## Why should you learn JavaScript?

So you need some motivation! Umm... I'm sure there are many more, but right now I can think of these:  
  - __Necessity__ - [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is the _only_ programming language (apart from [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)) supported by the common web browsers. It's the tool you need to make your web pages alive and interactive. 
  - __Popularity__ - It's insanely popular! From technology giants to primary school students - everyone uses JavaScript. It's the most loved, discussed, and hated programming language globally. Based on [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018), nearly 70% of all questions asked on the platform are related to JavaScript. 
  - __Employability__ - Millions of programmers use JavaScript; for many, it is the first programming language they learned. They had charted out glittering careers as developers, bloggers, product mangers, analysts, etc. Learning JavaScript makes you employable in almost any corner of the planet where internet has pervaded.
  - __Applicability__ - Modern JavaScript allows us to write extremely complex and rich web applications, covering everything from backend code running on the server to frontend code running on the browsers. _Learn one, rule all_!. But beware of the deadly trap - professional JavaScript programmers are clustered in highly fragmented communities, each following a [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) like a religion. What's ridiculous is they change their religion as soon as a new hot religion emerges.
  - __Freedom__ - It's free, open source, and standardised by a committee behind [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). You don't need to pay anything to learn and apply it.
  - __Embarrassment__ - Not knowing the basics of JavaScript is embarrassing if you work in a technology company, and especially if the company has build it's product with JavaScript.     

  
## What's JavaScript?    

> JavaScript is a __loosely typed__, __interpreted__, and __object oriented__ programming language widely used for __scripting web applications__.

Oooff... that's quite a heavy and geeky definition! But what does it really mean? Let's break it into chunks and understand what they mean at a very high level. In due course, you will also learn some of the things that are common with other programming languages like Python, Java, etc.

  - __loosely typed__ -     
  - __interpreted__ -     
  - __object oriented__ -     
  - __scripting web applications__ -
